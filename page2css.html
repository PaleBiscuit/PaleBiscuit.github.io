            <h2>CSS notes</h2>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The basic anatomy of CSS syntax written for both inline styles and stylesheets.</li>
                    <li>Some commonly used CSS terms, such as ruleset, selector, and declaration.</li>
                    <li>CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.</li>
                    <li>Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.</li>
                    <li>An internal stylesheet is written using the &lt;style&gt; element inside the &lt;head&gt; element of an HTML file.</li>
                    <li>Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.</li>
                    <li>An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the “.css”.file extension.</li>
                    <li>External stylesheets are the best approach when it comes to using HTML and CSS.</li>
                    <li>External stylesheets are linked to HTML using the &lt;link&gt; element.</li>
                    <li>CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.</li>
                    <li>All elements can be selected using the universal selector.</li>
                    <li>An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.</li>
                    <li>Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.</li>
                    <li>IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.</li>
                    <li>Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.</li>
                    <li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
                    <li>Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.</li>
                    <li>The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.</li>
                    <li>Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.</li>
                    <li>Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.</li>
                    <li>Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border.</li>
                    <li>Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.</li>
                    <li>Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin.</li>
                    <li>margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.</li>
                    <li>In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.</li>
                    <li>The box-sizing property controls the box model used by the browser.</li>
                    <li>The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.</li>
                    <li>The value for the new box model is border-box.</li>
                    <li>The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding.</li>
                    <li>...</li>
